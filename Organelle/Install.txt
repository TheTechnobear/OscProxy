OscProxy

this allows the Organelle to be used as 'Controller' for applications running on another machine

an example would be:

developing a pure patch on your macOS for the Organelle
so you run Pure Data on your Mac, and this OscProxy client

on the Organelle you run the OscHost

now your Organelle can control your patch running on your Mac


Note: This is a 'development tool'


Installing

Organelle
---------
put OscHost onto the Usbdrive in System (create if required)
e.g.
/usbdrive/System/OscHost

you will need to edit the run.sh to insert your IP address of your PC/Mac
(eg /usbdrive/System/OscHost/run.sh )

then run OscHost on the Organelle... its like a 'patch'

Client
---------
put 'Clients' anywhere you want
then run either run_linux.sh or run_macos.sh

note: this assumes organelle's host name can be resolved with 'organelle'
if not you will want to edit the appropriate run script to put the ip address
